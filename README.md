## About


The service exposes multiple endpoints using controllers, covering most of the MultiversX API
- AccountController
- BlockController
- SmartContractController
- TransactionController
- ESDTController

You can find a Postman collection in the ```postman``` folder to test all the endpoints.
Also, you can find a test wallet and payload files for transactions / functions.
